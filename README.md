For this lab, we, Keagan Mataga and Erick, focused on setting up a web development environment, creating a basic HTML webpage, and learning version control with Git and GitHub. We started by installing Visual Studio Code, which served as our code editor, along with Git for version control and Node.js with npm for JavaScript development. Once everything was set up, we created a project folder named web-dev-lab, where we added an index.html file containing a simple webpage structure. Using the Live Server extension in VS Code, we were able to preview our webpage in a browser.

Next, we moved on to Git and GitHub setup. We configured Git by adding our usernames and emails, then initialized a Git repository in our project folder. After that, we created a new repository on GitHub and linked it to our local project. We committed our changes and pushed them to GitHub successfully. To practice Git workflow, we created and updated a hello.txt file with our names and student IDs. Additionally, we created a new branch called feature-branch, added a feature.txt file with a short message about what we learned, and merged it into the main branch using a pull request.

As part of the collaboration task, we forked each otherâ€™s repositories, made meaningful contributions such as fixing minor errors and improving documentation, and submitted pull requests. This lab was a great hands-on experience in setting up a development environment, writing HTML, and working with Git and GitHub for version control and teamwork. It provided practical exposure to real-world software development workflows and collaboration techniques.
