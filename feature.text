This lab helped me learn how to install and set up VS Code, Git, and Node.js, create a basic HTML webpage, and use GitHub for version control. 
I practiced committing changes, creating branches, and collaborating with a partner. 
It gave me hands-on experience with essential web development and Git workflows.
